# Applied-Machine-Learning

## Assignment 1

### Setup & Installation

#### import all important Libraries 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import sklearn
### How to Run the Program in step 1 to respectivly:
1. Download the notebook (Applied Machine Learning.ipynb).
2. Open Jupyter Notebook in the project directory: "jupyter notebook"
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to execute the machine learning workflow.
   
4. ### Prerequisites
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    
5. ### Dependencies:
 The following libraries are used in the notebook:
    1. numpy
    2. pandas
    3. matplotlib.pyplot
    4. seaborn
    5. sklearn (including metrics, model_selection, preprocessing, and svm)

  6. Import the files and read the shape the given code in Cell
  7. Check the random Images , verify the labels are not duplicate
  8. Then Check the duplicates; ineed had some similar images bt they were not the duplicates so kept in the data set.
  9. Compute pixel intensity standard deviation for each image; (Data distrubution is in Bell Shaped Curve)
  10. Check the Visualize pixel intensity distribution
  11. No Null Values seen in this step
  12. Created Confusion Matrix
  13. Final step,Training & Testing Data Report : Resluts are 98% can see in the python notebook
  14. Final Bar chart for F1 score for (Validation vs Test) shwows the approximatly similar results.
  15. Overall, The model is performing exceptionally well and does not seem to suffer from major issues. The SVM model achieved 98% accuracy, demonstrating strong classification performance across all digit classes.
